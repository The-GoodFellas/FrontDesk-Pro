FrontDesk Pro is a hotel management system designed to simplify front desk operations. It allows staff and administrators to manage guest check-ins and check-outs, view room availability, create reservations, and maintain hotel records through a secure, role-based system.

## Basic Functionality

* Secure Login: Admins and staff log in with individual accounts. The system verifies credentials before granting access.

* Guest Management: Staff can add, edit, and view guest information such as name, contact details, and stay dates.
  
* Room Management: Admins and staff can check room availability, assign guests to rooms, and update room status after check-out.

* Reservation Handling: Reservations can be created, updated, or canceled. Each reservation links a guest to a room with specific check-in and check-out times.

* Admin Controls: Administrators can manage staff accounts, modify system settings, and access the ledger for transaction records.
  
* Ledger Tracking: The system automatically logs check-ins, check-outs, and payments for easy reference and accountability.
