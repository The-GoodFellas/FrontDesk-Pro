git# FrontDesk Pro

## Overview

FrontDesk Pro is a hotel management system designed to simplify front desk operations. It allows staff and administrators to manage guest check-ins and check-outs, view room availability, create reservations, and maintain hotel records through a secure, role-based system.

## Basic Functionality

* Secure Login: Admins and staff log in with individual accounts. The system verifies credentials before granting access.
